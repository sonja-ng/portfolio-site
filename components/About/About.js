                        I am an exhibition manager turned software engineer. With a background in art history, I value creativity and clean syntax when writing code and especially enjoy 
                        building beautiful optimized full-stack applications.

                         I have built projects with technologies like <Span>React</Span>, <Span>Redux</Span>, <Span>JavaScript</Span>, <Span>Ruby on Rails</Span>, <Span>MongoDB</Span>, <Span>SQL</Span>, <Span>Express.js</Span>,
